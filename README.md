Website Idea: It can be used to publish personal thougts in public through blogs, anyone can read and comment.

Functionalities:
1. Users can send texts
2. Author can publish his blogs using admin panel
3. Blog-readers can comment on the blogs
4. Users can search and filter the blogs by category
5. Author can also add new categories using admin panel

Used in making this:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JS
4. PHP

Some disadvantages:
1. Users can't delete or edit a comment after it is added
2. Author can't edit his blog after he publishes it but can delete his blogs 
3. Author can also delete the comments of users if he doesn't like it.


I am really grateful that you came this far to have a look at my trivial project. :D
